DESCRIPTION FOR RAM DESIGN:SRAM (Static RAM): Uses transistors to store data, offering faster access times but is more expensive.

DRAM (Dynamic RAM): Uses capacitors and transistors, requiring periodic refreshing of the stored data but is more cost-effective.

RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that allows data to be accessed in any order, enabling quick read and write operations. It's a crucial component for storing data and instructions that the CPU needs while the computer is running. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its data when the power is turned off.

OUTPUT data_out = 0x56
